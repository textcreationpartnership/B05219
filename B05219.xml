            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The Committee of Estates according to the Power and Authority wherewith they are entrusted by the Estates of Parliament; Do Prorogate and continue the Monethly Maintenance in that proportion it was first laid on, and that for the space of four moneths, <hi>viz.</hi> From the first day of <hi>October</hi> next to come, till the first day of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1649. And Statutes and Ordains that ilk Shire and Burgh within the Kingdom, are and shall be lyable and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in payment of the particular sums of money under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written for each of the saids four moneths, and that without any suspension or dimunition, and at the times, and in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner afterspecified: And Ordains the same to be payed in to Sir <hi>John Weems</hi> of Bogie Thesaurer of the Army and Commissary Generall of the Kingdom, and to his Deputies and Sub-Collectors appointed by him for receiving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at the termes following: The maintenance of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of <hi>October</hi> betwixt and the sixth day of the said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, And the maintenance of the other three moneths betwixt and the tenth day of the saids moneths <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective:</hi> And in regard of the great sums already borrowed on private security, and layed out for the outreik of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and of other incident necessary charges daily occurring for the furtherance of this work: The Committee of Estates for relief and dispatch thereof, do appoint and ordain the Maintenance of the said moneth of <hi>October</hi> to be payed in reall money to the Commissary, without any suspension, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance or deduction whatsomever.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179975:3"/>the hundreth pounds promised for each horse to be put out in this present Levy, and of the ordinary quarterings. The Committee doth declare, that the saids hundreth pounds in the first place, and then the Quarterings due and exacted (conform to the Act of Quarterings of the 22. of <hi>February</hi> 1645. and according to the Establishment hereunto subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) in the moneths of <hi>October, November, December,</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> shall affect and be allowed in the maintenance of the three moneths of <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>January</hi> next to come, And it is hereby declared that no quarterings whatsomever are in any wayes to be allowed to any Shyre untill first the Levie due out of that Shyre, be compleatlie put out and the same attested by the Officers who have the charge thereof; But that these forces who are or shall be raised, be quartered on free quarters on the deficients of the Shire, till the numbers be compleat: And then the hail to be quartered proportionally and equally through the hail Shire by advice and Order of the Committee of the Shire: And in case it shal happen that the forces raised in any Shire be called by publict Order, for the publique service to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shire; then the quartering of these Forces to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Maintenance of the aforesaid three moneths; And the Shires whereunto they are called to have their relief out of the Maintenance of these Shires from which they are called. Provided, always likeas it is hereby specially decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that no allowance of quarterings is to be granted to any Shires or Burghs of the Forces (if any shall happen to be) sent to them, to force them to do their duty in putting out their men; and paying their by-gone Maintenance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes. But that all forces so employed be on Free Quarter, whereof the Shire or Burgh so deficient is to have no relief. And seeing for the most part the deficiency in these
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179975:4"/>publict duties, is most in the Heretors and masters: And that it were hard that the poor Tenents and Labourers of the ground should suffer for their Masters fault; It is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Free Quarters aforesaid to be raised off any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents whose Masters and Landlords are deficient &amp; do not concur for advancing of this publict service, shall be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and discompted to the Tenent in the first end of the Rent, or duely he is to pay to his Master or Heretor of the ground.</p>
